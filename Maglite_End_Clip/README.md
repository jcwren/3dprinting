# Maglite Holder

Maglite\_Holder\_Rounded.stl is from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1747635

Rotate Maglite\_Holder\_Rounded 270 around Y axis (small side of cup against
build plate)

At some point, Maglite changed the body diameter of the D-cell flashlights from
41.7mm to 39.4mm (2.3mm smaller). This may be why some of the other clip
designs on Thingiverse fit some flashlights and not others.
