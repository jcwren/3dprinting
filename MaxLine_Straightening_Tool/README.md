# Rapidair MaxLine Bending & Straightening Tools

These are made for the Rapidair 3/4" MaxLine air piping.

Printed in PETG, 25% infill.

Specifically designed not to require supports. The two halves of both the
wheels in the straightening tool and the form and drive rod support blocks in
the bending tool are glued together with Gorilla Original Gorilla Glue. This is
is a polyurethane formula that works well with PETG.

# Parts List
The straightening tool requires the following parts:
* 14 wheel halves (printed)
* 7 3/8"-16 x 3 1/2" hex bolts
* 7 3/8"-16 Nylock nuts
* 21 3/8" washers (SAE is fine, USS is better)
* 2 3/4" x 6" x 24" plywood

The bending tool requires the following parts:
* 2 form halves (printed)
* 2 bending blocks (printed)
* 2 short drive rod support block halves (printed)

# Bending Tool Assembly Instructions
## Drive Rod Support Blocks
1. Install a 3/8"-16 nut into the short drive rod support block with ears
1. Install a 3/8"-16 coupler into the long drive rod support block with ears
1. Place a **small** drop of glue in the alignment pin holes in each of the four blocks
1. Join the halves of the short drive rod support block and clamp
1. Join the halves of the long drive rod support block and clamp at each end
1. Remove any excess glue with a damp paper towel
1. Allow glue to dry for at least two hours
1. Remove any glue that subsequently squeezed out and dried (Xacto knife works well)
## Form Head
1. Place a 3/8" washer on to the 3/8"-16 threaded rod, about 1" from the end
1. Place a **small** drop of glue (or Loctite) on to the last 3 or 4 threads of the 3/8"-16 threaded rod
1. Attach a 3/8"-16 nut to the end of the 3/8"-16 threaded rod and screw down so the end of the nut is flush with the end of the rod
1. Allow glue or Loctite to dry for 30 minutes
1. Place a 3/8" washer into the washer slot closest to the curve of the form
1. Slide the washer on the threaded rod so it is up against the nut
1. Place the threaded rod into the form half with the washer so the nut is sitting in the nut pocket and the washer is in the washer pocket
1. Place a **small** drop of glue in each of the pin alignment pin holes in each of the form halves
1. Clamp the halves together
1. Verify the threaded rod can be easily rotated
1. Allow glue to dry for at least two hours
## Plywood Base
1. Apply thin coat of glue to one side of each plywood T piece
1. Clamp pieces together
1. If possible, use several 1-1/4" brad nails to join parts (keeps parts from slipping)
1. Allow to dry for 2 hours
1. Optionally sand both sides of assembled piece smooth and radius edges
1. Optionally paint plywood or seal plywood with a clear coat of ployurethane
1. Lightly mark a line down the center of the leg of the T to find center
1. Lightly mark a line across the center of the top of the T to find center
