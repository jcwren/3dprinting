## 2016 Subaru Outback Cup Holder

Standard soft drink cans tend to shift around in the cup holder and slosh
somewhat when going over speedbumps or tight turns.

Yes, there's a million ways I could have used a little less PLA, like putting
lots of holes in the sides, or a cylinder with 4, 6, or 8 ridges on the side.
This was quick, and is just a cylinder within a cone.

## 2019 Ford Edge ST Cup Holder

The springy ears in the Edge compress a soft drink can really hard, and often
cause it to slosh. This allows the ears in the cup holder to firmly hold the
adapter and allow the soft drink can to easily slip in and out. There are
little tabs in the bottom to keep the adapter centered and to prevent it from
going all the way to the bottom.
