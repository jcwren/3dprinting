# Well Pump Mounting Plate

This is a plate designed to mount an ESP32-POE-ISO board and a 220V
optoisolator board inside a LeMotech 5.9"x 4.3"x 2.8" IP65 enclosure.

This is not an ideal junction box for a mains powered circuit, as it's not 94V0
rated nor NEC approved. I'd prefer the optoisolator be in a metal box with a
ground, but trying to find a decent box was a PITA.
