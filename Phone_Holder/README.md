# Phone\_Holder

This is a phone holder for a 2019 Ford Edge ST and a Google Pixel 4 XL phone in
a particular case.

The base section goes into the little space in front of the cup holder. It uses
a piece of 1" x 0.125" aluminum bar from most any hardware store to hold the
phone holder section. It can be bent to any angle that makes you happy.

When printed with Inland white PETG, the aluminum slips in fairly easily, and
should perhaps be epoxied in. With Prusa white PETG it was much tighter, and
I had to clamp the bar in a vise and tap the base on, then flip it over and
tap the phone holder on.

Print with 30% to 40% infill for a nice weight with plenty of strength.
