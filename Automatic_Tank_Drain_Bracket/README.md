# Automatic Tank Drain Bracket

This is a bracket for an automatic tank drain for an air compressor. Purchased from Amazon at this [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00273WV78/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

The 3/4"-16 UNF nut clamps the bracket in place. I drilled holes in the bottom of the bracket and attached it to a block of wood for more stability.
