# IMSAI Power

This is a box that mounts to the back of the IMSAI 8080 for a power entry
module.

I replaced the original power supply with several switchers mounted on a sheet
of plexiglass. The first requirement was that I was not going to make any
changed that required modifying the chassis.

The original power supply was fed by a cord that enters through a hole that's
below and to the right of the lower right corner screw for the fan (viewed from
the back). The power switch is on the front of the IMSAI front panel, and is a
total shock hazard. The fuse for the power supply is mounted on the power
supply board.

As I definitely wanted a fuse and power switch, but didn't want to modify the
chassis, the only solution I came up with was to use a power entry module that
has a combined IEC C14 socket, fuse, and power switch. If I recall correctly,
these either came from DigiKey or eBay, and weren't very expensive.

To mount this, a 3D printed box was created. The box covers 3 of the DB25
punch-outs on the back of the chassis and uses their screw holes to mount it.
The hot, neutral, and ground wire enter the chassis through on of the punch-
out holes.

The front panel power switch is not connected, and no longer presents a shock
hazard. The box is strong enough to handle the cord being inserted and removed.
Overall, it met the desigh criteria I set out to achieve.
