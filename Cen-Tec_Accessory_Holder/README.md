# Accessory storage ring for Cen-Tec QuickClick connectors and 1.5" to 2.25" adapter

This ring sits on top of the dust separator and allows for the QuickClick tool
adapters and the 1.5" to 2.25" vacuum adapter to be conveniently stored.

Printed in Jet Black Prusament PETG on a Prusa MK3S+ at 15% infill. No other options
are required. Takes about 9h45m to print, uses 106g (34.58m) of filament and takes
9h45m to print.

Base plate could possibly be a little thinner and would likely be OK at 10% infill,
but I'd prefer for it to have no flexing.
