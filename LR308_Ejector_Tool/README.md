This is a tool for holding an AR-10/LR-308 bolt when removing the ejector pin.

The concept is based on the $63 version Brownells sells. Theirs, of course, is
made of metal, and does both AR-15 and AR-10 bolts. I thought it would be more
fun to make one, and since there wasn't already one on Thingiverse, it would be
a useful addition.

This is configured to printed with ABS, and accounts for the shinkage factor. I
chose ABS because I already had it loaded in the printer, and I felt like PLA
might be too brittle (perhaps not, I haven't tried it).

The metal bits that are required are a 3/8" x 18 nut, and a 3/8" x 1" x 18
thumbscrew (best), hex-headed bolt (OK), or screw (ick). The included cap goes
over the end of screw threads, and can be affixed with a dab of silicone
adhesive, although pretty much anything should work well.

Holes are provided for #6 sheet metal screws, should there be a desire to
attach it to a piece of wood for additional stability.

Printed on a Prusa i3 Mk3, Inland 1.75mm ABS (blue!). 20% infill, vertical
perimeters to 7 (recommended, not required. I get better results with 7), no
raft or brim, no supports. I use 255/245 head temps, and 110/110 bed temps, 
and don't get any warping.
