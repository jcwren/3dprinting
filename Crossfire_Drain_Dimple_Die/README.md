These are the Fusion 360 files, drawings, and 3D printable STL files for
forming the drain on the Langmuir Crossfire CNC plasma cutter water table.

There were done by Dan Brubaker on the Langmuir forums. There are all his work,
and are available here for posterity.  The original post is at
https://forum.langmuirsystems.com/t/pan-drain-dimple-die-mod-2/13000.

I printed the parts in PETG with 100% infill. You'll need a 3/4"-10 x 2.5"
bolt, nut, and 2 washers to use the die. Center the die in the drain (the
die is a tad bit small, really), and torque to 60 lb-ft. You should get a
nice little recess that the top of the drain will be just flush with the
table.

I replaced the Langmuir drain with a drain from Amazon, available at
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P7SBKWX. Replace the top rubber ring with a 1"
nitrile O-ring, and don't use the bottom rubber washer. I bedded in some butyl
tape around the top edge of the drain it to ensure a good seal.

The instructions in the water table say to attach the work lead to the
drain. If both the O-ring and the bottom rubber washer are in place, the
drain will not make a good electrical contact to the table. If you choose
to use both the O-ring and washer, attach the work lead somewhere else.
