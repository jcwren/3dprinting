# Yoke\_Cap

This is a cap that can be used in place of an actual yoke to keep a
transmission from leaking fluid everywhere.

This particular one is for a Saginaw 3 speed or any transmission that
uses a yoke with a 1.50" outer / 1.17" inner diameter. It's actually
a little tight, and could probably be opened up to 1.20" or so to fit
on easier.
