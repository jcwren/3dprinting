It seems that there several different thicknesses for the Craftsman open-end
box wrenches. Using a 5/8" as an example, I have one that has no part number
stamped on it, where the thickness of the open end face is 7.52mm, one with
stamped with P/N 44697 where the thickness is 8.12mm, and yet another with the
same part number which is 7.26mm. The handle and imprint area all vary in
thickness correspondingly.
