These are brackets for a DPS-1200FB type switching power supply.

Two #6 screws are used to secure each bracket to a board. There are slots to
run a tie-wrap underneath to lock down the supply. You'll likely need to daisy-
chain two tie-wraps unless you have some 14" or longer ones.

Sliced in Slic3r PE 2.1.3, printed on Prusa Mk3 with Generic PET settings.
