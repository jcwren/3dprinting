WORK IN PROGRESS!

These pieces join two or more 140mm fans together

The top pieces are designed to hook over a 3/4" piece of plywood. The bottom
pieces are designed to sit on top of a 3/4" x 1/2" bar. A picture of why
they're this way would help immensely, and perhaps one day I'll upload one.

The tapered screw holes are for the self-tapping screws that come with most
PC fans. The holes in the end caps are for a #6 sheet metal screw. The holes
in the bottom middle pieces are also for a #6 sheet metal screw, but are 
oversized (because I forgot to fix them).
