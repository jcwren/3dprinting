This is a plug to block off the resonator tube on the air filter to throttle
body tube. If the tube on the resonator is torn, the only option is to replace
the entire resonator assembly. Popular consensus is that the resonator doesn't
serve any real useful purpose, and it gets in the way for replacing the fuel
filter and a few other things, so just remove it.
