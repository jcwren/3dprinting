These are parts for an Avalon 751 ASIC miner.

The other fan ducts I found on Thingiverse either looked *really* crappy or
didn't fit any known flex duct sizes. I wanted one that didn't use 16m of
filament and take 6 hours to print, and had a nice ridge to prevent the hose
from slipping off.

Number 6 screws are used to secure each bracket to a board. There are slots to
run a tie-wrap underneath to lock down the miner. They're setup for the larger
tie-wraps used in HVAC duct work and such.

Sliced in Slic3r PE 2.1.3, printed on Prusa Mk3 with Generic ABS settings.
0.15mm, no support, 20% infill. Created in OpenSCAD.
