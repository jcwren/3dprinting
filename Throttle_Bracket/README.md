# Throttle Bracket

This is not actually a 3D print. It's the layout for the bracket described
below, and is meant to be formed from 0.100" mild steel or aluminum. I didn't
have a better place to file it, so it went with the 3D printing projects.

This is a throttle cable bracket that fits a Holley 2300 bolt pattern. It is
specifically for a Sniper EFI body. The bracket should be bent at the 'L' tab.

The hole in the tab is sized for the right angle cable guide of a Sudco 657901
cable I found on eBay. I installed the Sniper on a Chevy 250 inline-6, with the
fuel inlet/return away from the valve cover. This meant the throttle cable
wrapped around the Sniper, and entered from the valve cover side. There is not
enough clearance for it to enter straight in, so the right angle cable guide
was scavenged from the Sudco kit.
