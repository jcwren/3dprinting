These are for mounting the PIDP8I front panel to the case.

This is made for a Pi 3 Model B+. If used with a Pi Zero, it'll still work,
there's just some wasted space.

It's overkill, for sure.  You can use the wood blocks that came with the kit,
assuming they're the right dimensions (mine weren't). I wanted it to be rigidly
mounted. Screw the PCB to the mounts, then figure out where the holes should be
in the wooden case, them drill them slightly oversize. Put a washer under the
screw, and now you've got a little room to shift the PCB around to line up
correctly in the acrylic.

Per the instructions, you're supposed to mount the PCB to the far right in the
box, and the bottoms of the switch tabs should be up on the edge where the
plexiglass sits. That made the plexi a uneven in the box, and for my build, the
switches weren't in the right position. I used a Dremel tool and cut the tabs
off so there was no sign of the hole. Before I did, I marked the back of the
case where the screw holes should roughly be.

Printed with 10% gyroid infill in PETG. Screw holes are sized for M3 sheet
metal or machine screws.
